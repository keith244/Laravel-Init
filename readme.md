# Laravel Init
Automate Laravel project setup with a simple python script

## Why this project exists
I wanted to learn more about automation using Python, so why not do it with Laravel?
Setting up Laravel projects manually can be tedious, so this tool helps solve that pain point while letting me practice real-world Python automation.
